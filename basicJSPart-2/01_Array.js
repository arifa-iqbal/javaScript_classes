let arrEmpty = [];
console.log(arrEmpty);
// let see with number data type
let numArry = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(numArry);
// in console we can observe that the length shown as 5 but the index show 4 this is because in array its start whith 0 index.
// let see what if we did this
let arr = new Array(5);
console.log(arr);
// this is arry with specified length but in result it shows the empty arry with length 5.its just for learn perpose
