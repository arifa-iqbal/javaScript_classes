    // lets talk about events in javascript.
    // events are actions that occur in the browser that the user can trigger.
    // for example, when a user clicks on a button or hovers over on an image, an event is triggered.
    // we can use event listeners to listen for these events and execute a function when the event occurs.
    // some events which are important to know: type, timeStamp, defaultPrevented, target,toElement,srcElement,currentTarget,clientX, clientY,screenX, screenY,altKey, ctrlKey,shiftKey, keyCode
    // lets talke brefly about these events.
    // type: the type event that occurred. for example click, mouseover, keydown, etc.
    // timeStamp: the time at which the event occurred.
    // defaultPrevented: a boolean value that tindicates wether the default action of the event has been prevented or not.
    // target: the element that trageted the value of the event.
    // what is event propagation?
    // event propagation is the way in which events are handled in the Dom.
