// lets talk about while loop in javascript
// while loop is used to execute a block of code as long as the condition is true
// while loop is used when we dont know how many times the loop will run
// while loop syntax as follows
//while(condition){code to be executed}

// example of ewhile loop
// let i = 0;
// while (i < 5) {
//   console.log("i is less than 5", i);
//   i++;
// }
let i = 0;
while (i <= 20) {
  console.log(`the value of i is ${i}`);
  i++;
}
